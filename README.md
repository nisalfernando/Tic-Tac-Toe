## Tic Tac Toe Game - A Free Code Camp project

This is the 3rd of the "Advance" projects in the old FreeCodeCamp curriculum. In the initail vanilla JS version I learnt about how to code an "automated" computer player. In the React version, I learnt a lot about dealing with 'setState'. The fact that it is asynchronous presented an interesting challenge.
